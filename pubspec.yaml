   - assets/3.jpg
   - assets/4.jpg
   - assets/5.jpg
   - assets/6.jpg
   - assets/7.jpg
   - assets/8.jpg
   - assets/9.jpg
   - assets/10.jpg
   - assets/avatar.jpeg
   - assets/sofa.png
   - assets/wardrobe.png
   - assets/desk.png
   - assets/desks.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Quicksand
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/Quicksand-Regular.ttf
        #   weight: 300
        # - asset: assets/Quicksand-Light.ttf
        #   weight: 500
        # - asset: assets/Quicksand-Medium.ttf
        #   weight: bold
        # - asset: assets/Quicksand-Bold.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
